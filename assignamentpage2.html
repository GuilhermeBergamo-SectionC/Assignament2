                <h2>Hollow Knight</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight is an indie game that was released in February 2017. The game is a Metroidvania that tells the story of a hollow knight. Despite the game being published almost seven years ago, it's still one of my favorite games of all time. One of the reasons I love this game is the freedom that you have; you can play the game in almost any order that you want. The game's combat is also genius; in the beginning, it is pretty simple, but in the end, it becomes one of the most complex combat systems I've ever played. The music from the game is also one of the best gaming osts ever.</p>

                <h2> The Legend of Zelda:Tears of The Kingdom</h2>
                <p>Zelda Tears of the Kingdom was released in May 2023 and is a gaming masterpiece. The game is an action adventure in the vast world of Hyrule. The sheer size of this world is unbelievable, having the ground layer, underground map, and floating Islands. Similarly to Hollow Knight, this game gives the player freedom; if you are on a floating island and see something on the map that interests you, you can go there. The combat of the game is also excellent despite its simplicity. The Zelda franchise is known for having some of the most iconic music from the videogame in general, and this game is no exception, bringing back and making new legendary osts.</p>
