                            This music is the theme for a location on the map called the "City of the Tears." The whole map of Hollow Knight is underground, and so when you first come to the city, it feels weird to be raining all the time, but that is until you discover that all the "rain" was just the water that passed through some cracks in the ground on the river that is on the top of the city. The music's melancholy reflects the city's state: dead, without anyone.

                            This music represents a specific moment in the game when the Grimm troupe invades Hollownest(the "country" in the game). This music plays when facing the troupe as you try to understand what is happening. It perfectly translates all of the agony and fear you think of when they invade the city.
